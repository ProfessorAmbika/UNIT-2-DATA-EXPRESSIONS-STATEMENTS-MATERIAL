<div style="justify">
Wherever HTML is rendered on GitHub (gists, README files in repos, comments on issues and pull requests, ...) you can use any of the HTML elements that GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) provides syntactic sugar for. You can either use the syntactic sugar that GFM (or other GitHub-supported markup language you're using) provides or, since Markdown can contain raw HTML, you can enter the HTML tags manually.
